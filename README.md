This is the front-end for [Arts-Based Learning in Business](https://ablb.atec.io).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed to get started developing.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies. 

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
